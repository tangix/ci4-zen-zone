# First release of Apiary Logger

The first release of my Ext JS/CI4 sample project Apiary Logger is now released. With this project I want to show some of the techniques I have picked up during my years with both products and also give back to the CI4 community.

As I always acquired new skills by applying them to a project at hand I took an example from my hobby as beekeeper and created a simple logging tool for an Apiary. There are a couple of these tools available but strangely we have found them all missing some features so maybe this sample project will turn into the perfect Apiary Management Tool, who knows?

Check out the project in [GitHub](https://github.com/tangix/ci4-apiary-logger). 

Requirements:
* PHP 7.2+ with extensions enabled as required by CI4
* SQLite3 PHP extension enabled
* Working ``composer`` installation
