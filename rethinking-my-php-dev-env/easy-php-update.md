# Efforts paying off - easy PHP updates

With all pieces in place the update from PHP 8.1.12 / 7.4.31 to 8.1.13 / 7.4.33 was very smooth. A simple change to the `.env`, file bumping the versions and then a `make build`.

For sure, the PHP installations `homebrew` maintained on my previous machine worked good but they came in an uncontrolled manner when doing a `brew update`.

Life is good!
